<p>i am 17 years old i create music and i like hanging out with my friends.Im also apart of a youtube content group called the crew that makes vr content. my music is pop/rap.I also have a youtube channel you guys should go check it out.</p>
<p>I started singing when i was 9 years old. i started making my own music when i was 12 years old. In my past i have learned that the people that are closes to you hurt you the most so i keep my friendship circle small and try to have a good time.
